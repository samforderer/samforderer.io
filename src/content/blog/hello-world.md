description: Some introductory thoughts and an explanation of the name, blackbox. 
---

A blackbox is a term for a system that takes inputs and gives an output, without the user knowing how the output was achieved. It's opaque, you cant see inside of it. As far as the user is concerned, it works like *magic*. Computing systems are built from layers upon layers of abstraction. So anytime you are interacting with a computer system, you are interacting with some form of a blackbox. The part of the blackbox the user interacts with is called an *interface*. The interface provides us a simplified control panel to interact with the blackbox and receive an output without having to understand all the nitty gritty details. I think this metaphor of a blackbox is really profound and can be applied to almost anything in life. 

In a way, even human beings are blackboxes. We take sensory inputs, and produce outputs, most of the time without fully understanding the internal workings of our own mind. So, what better name for a blog about computing and people than **blackbox.** The logo is pretty obviously a blackbox taking two inputs and producing an output using some kind of computational magic. Which brings me to my next idea..
## the magic
A key theme here is the idea of magic. The fact that we don't fully understand how the output is produced gives us a sense of mystery and wonder. In life, not just programming, it's crucial to maintain this sense of awe and magic. Sometimes, being too analytical and mathematical can strip away the joy and wonder from our experiences. Maintaining this magic is a core philosophy of mine. I think to be great we have to be **constantly learning**. But learning new things is hard and willpower is fragile. Fascination and curiosity are the most powerful motivators and the fuel we need to be great.  

This theme of magic also relates to my fascination with computers. There's a quote by Jony Ive that I think captures it well:

> 'People perceive value beyond their ability to articulate why.' 

And another quote from my favourite childhood book, The Little Prince: 

> 'What is essential is invisible to the eye'

A friend of mine is obsessed with cars. I never understood the fascination. To me it is just a tool to get from point A to point B. I expressed this to him and he told me "When I look at a car there is something that I see that you do not." I really reflected on that and realized that there is some inarticulable magic there for him the same way that I see magic in my interests. A lot of it probably has to do with childhood experiences and encounters of stuff we're into.

For example, us Gen Z'ers, were the first generation to grow up with the internet as a norm, with personal computers in our homes from an early age. We witnessed major milestones in computing technology, from the rise of home computers to the advent of social media. But what stands out most to me is how the computer always felt like a digital world to be exploredâ€”a wild frontier where anything was possible. A safe haven from the cold, unforgiving world. It felt more like an old library, full of secrets and dusty corners to explore and get lost in. The web in it's current state feels more like basic cable; a bunch of cheap, surface-level content aggregated into a select few channels. 

In the early days of web 2.0, before mega-corporations monetized and standardized the web, there was a profound sense of discovery and exploration. Unfortunately, this era came to an end as the web became more content-driven and algorithm-driven. We were no longer exploring; instead, we were directed to specific places through targeted advertising and algorithmic feeds.

Despite these changes, the magical experiences and nostalgia of using computers as a child continue to fuel my love for technology. The wonder and mystery of it all are CRUCIAL, and my advice is to keep that magic alive as best as you can; stay curious!
## the plan 
So, anyway, aside from all my philosophical ramblings, here is what I plan to write about:
- to document my software-development and CompSci learnings
- to post about hard problems I encounter so I can remember solutions 
- to share thoughts about life

Thanks for stopping by and hope you visit again soon!## the name
