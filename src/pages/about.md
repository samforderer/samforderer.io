Hi, I am a software development student working as a junior application develop co-op right now. I am extremely passionate about computing and this blog is a place for me to document my learning journey! I am self-studying a lot of CompSci concepts, and I wanted to cement my learning by writing about them. We all know that you don't really understand a topic until you can teach it to someone else. I come from a design/art background so I also really like to explore where design and technology intersect. 

Please feel free to reach out! [email](mailto:samforderer@icloud.com).
